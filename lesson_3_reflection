When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>>when i have contributers for my project working from different places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>>coz every time we make changes we might not be sure about it that whether should i change my copy of work or not!


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 >>FORK:- it is used to clone a repo from one github url to own github           web
   Clones:- clone a repo from given url to the computer(similar to           download and will be available offline)
          
   Branches:- it levels the commit by a name and create a different copy               of it which can be modified separetely.
